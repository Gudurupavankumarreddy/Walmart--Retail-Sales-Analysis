## 🧠 Business Problem

> **Walmart operates 45 stores across different regions.**
> **What drives sales performance — and what is the real impact of holidays, seasonality, and economic conditions like unemployment and inflation?**

As a retail chain, Walmart faces four critical business questions every quarter:

| # | Business Question | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | When do sales peak and when do they slow down? | Drives inventory ordering schedules |
| 2 | Do holidays genuinely boost sales — and by how much? | Decides staffing levels and stock volumes |
| 3 | Which stores are top performers and which carry risk? | Guides resource allocation decisions |
| 4 | How do unemployment and fuel prices affect revenue? | Helps predict and respond to economic downturns |

This project answers all four questions with data.

## 🔍 Project Walkthrough

---

### 🐍 Layer 1 — Python: Data Cleaning & EDA

#### Step 1 — Data Loading & Validation

```python
df = pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH)

df.head(10)            # Preview structure
df.shape               # (6435, 8) — rows and columns
df.isnull().sum()      # Check for missing values per column
df.duplicated().sum()  # Check for duplicate records
df.info()              # Data types and memory usage
df.describe()          # Statistical summary (min, max, mean, std)
```

> **Why this step exists:**
> Raw data is never trusted without inspection first.
> In this dataset the `Date` column was stored as a plain string —
> meaning Python could not sort, filter, or group it by time without conversion.
> Catching issues like this at the start prevents incorrect results from
> flowing into every chart and query built afterwards.

---

#### Step 2 — Data Cleaning

```python
# Convert Date from string to proper datetime
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'], format='%d-%m-%Y', errors='coerce')

# Drop rows where critical fields are null
before_rows = len(df)
df = df.dropna(subset=["Date", "Weekly_Sales", "Store", "Holiday_Flag"])
after_rows = len(df)
print(f"Dropped {before_rows - after_rows} rows due to invalid critical values")

# Enforce business rules
df = df[df["Weekly_Sales"] > 0]           # No zero or negative sales
df = df[df["Holiday_Flag"].isin([0, 1])]  # Only valid flag values (0 or 1)

# Sort chronologically for time-based analysis
df = df.sort_values(by='Date').reset_index(drop=True)
```

> **Why convert Date:**
> When stored as a string like `"05-02-2010"`, Python treats it as plain text.
> Sorting it alphabetically gives wrong order — `"12-01-2010"` would appear before `"05-02-2010"`.
> Converting to `datetime` makes all chronological operations correct.
>
> **Why enforce business rules:**
> A `Weekly_Sales` value of 0 or negative makes no business sense.
> These rows would pull down averages and distort trend lines if kept in the analysis.

---

#### Step 3 — Feature Engineering

```python
df["Year"]       = df["Date"].dt.year
df["Month"]      = df["Date"].dt.month
df["Month_Name"] = df["Date"].dt.month_name()
df["Week"]       = df["Date"].dt.isocalendar().week.astype(int)
```

> **Why extract these columns:**
> A single `Date` column cannot be used in `GROUP BY Month` or `GROUP BY Year` in SQL.
> Extracting them as separate columns makes time-based grouping possible everywhere.
> Since these columns are included in the exported CSV, SQL and Power BI
> use the same pre-computed values — no repeated logic, no risk of inconsistency.

---

#### Step 4 — Exploratory Data Analysis

**Yearly Sales Trend**
```python
yearly_sales = df.groupby('Year')['Weekly_Sales'].sum()
# Result → 2010: $2.34B | 2011: $2.42B (+6.1%) | 2012: $1.98B (-12.3%)
```

**Monthly Seasonality Pattern**
```python
monthly_sales = df.groupby('Month')['Weekly_Sales'].mean()
# Peak months  → July ($1.03M), November ($1.14M), December ($1.28M)
# Slowest month → January ($923K)
```

**Sales Heatmap — Year × Month**
```python
pivot = df.pivot_table(values="Weekly_Sales", index="Year",
                       columns="Month", aggfunc="mean")
sns.heatmap(pivot, cmap="YlGnBu")
plt.title("Sales Heatmap (Year vs Month)")
```
> This heatmap is a cross-validation tool.
> If the same seasonal pattern appears across all three years,
> it is a real structural pattern — not a data error or outlier.

**Weekly Sales Trend**
```python
weekly_sales = df.groupby('Date')['Weekly_Sales'].sum()
plt.plot(weekly_sales)
plt.title("Overall Weekly Sales Trend")
```
> The spikes on this chart align exactly with Thanksgiving weeks —
> confirming that the `Holiday_Flag` column is correctly encoded in the dataset.

**Holiday vs Non-Holiday**
```python
df.groupby('Holiday_Flag')['Weekly_Sales'].mean()
# Holiday weeks  → $1,122,888 avg
# Regular weeks  → $1,041,256 avg
# Lift           → +8%
```

---

#### Step 5 — Export Cleaned Dataset

```python
df.to_csv(OUTPUT_PATH, index=False, date_format="%Y-%m-%d")
```

> **Why export once and share downstream:**
> Python produces one validated, cleaned file.
> SQL and Power BI both read from this same file.
> If each tool did its own cleaning independently, small logic differences
> would cause numbers to disagree between dashboards and queries —
> a common and avoidable problem. One source of truth solves it.

---

### 🗃️ Layer 2 — MySQL: KPI Analysis & Views

#### Database & Table Setup

```sql
CREATE DATABASE walmart_analysis;
USE walmart_analysis;

CREATE TABLE walmart_sales (
    Store        INT NOT NULL,
    Date         DATE NOT NULL,
    Weekly_Sales DECIMAL(12,2) NOT NULL,
    Holiday_Flag TINYINT NOT NULL,
    Temperature  FLOAT,
    Fuel_Price   FLOAT,
    CPI          FLOAT,
    Unemployment FLOAT,
    Year         INT,
    Month        INT,
    Month_Name   VARCHAR(15),
    Week         INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (Store, Date)
);
```

> **Why PRIMARY KEY (Store, Date):**
> Each row represents one store's sales for one specific week.
> Store 1 cannot have two entries for the same date — it is physically impossible.
> The composite primary key enforces this uniqueness rule at the database level
> and prevents duplicate data from corrupting any aggregation.

---

#### Data Validation in SQL

```sql
-- Confirm row count and date range loaded correctly
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows, MIN(Date) AS start_date, MAX(Date) AS end_date
FROM walmart_sales;

-- Confirm Holiday_Flag only contains 0 or 1
SELECT Holiday_Flag, COUNT(*) AS records
FROM walmart_sales GROUP BY Holiday_Flag;

-- Confirm no zero or negative sales survived the cleaning step
SELECT * FROM walmart_sales WHERE Weekly_Sales <= 0;
```

> **Why validate in SQL after Python already cleaned the data:**
> The CSV export and `LOAD DATA INFILE` step can introduce problems —
> encoding issues, truncated rows, or wrong delimiters.
> SQL validation is a second checkpoint.
> This is called **end-to-end data integrity verification** and is
> standard practice in any professional analytics workflow.

---

#### Core Business Queries

| Query | SQL Technique | Business Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Yearly Sales Trend | `GROUP BY Year` | YoY performance comparison |
| Monthly Seasonality | `GROUP BY Month` | Seasonal pattern identification |
| Holiday vs Regular | `AVG` split by `Holiday_Flag` | Holiday impact baseline |
| Holiday Lift % | Conditional `AVG` + `NULLIF` | Lift % with zero-division protection |
| Top 10 Stores | `ORDER BY SUM DESC LIMIT 10` | Revenue leader identification |
| Store Rankings | `RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM DESC)` | Full 45-store performance ranking |
| Store-Wise Holiday Lift | Per-store conditional `AVG` + `HAVING` | Which stores benefit most from holidays |
| YoY Growth | `LAG()` window function + CTE | Year-over-year growth rate |
| Store Risk Scoring | `CASE WHEN` + `STDDEV` | Composite economic risk categorization |
| Seasonality Index | `CROSS JOIN` single-row CTE | Above/below-average month labeling |
| Holiday Lift by Month | Self-join on CTE | November vs December comparison |

---

#### Key SQL Patterns Explained

**Year-over-Year Growth using LAG()**
```sql
WITH yearly AS (
    SELECT Year, SUM(Weekly_Sales) AS total_sales
    FROM walmart_sales GROUP BY Year
)
SELECT Year, total_sales,
    LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY Year) AS prev_year_sales,
    ROUND(((total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY Year)) /
            LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY Year)) * 100, 2) AS growth_pct
FROM yearly;
```
> `LAG()` fetches the value from the previous row in the result.
> Ordered by Year, it returns last year's total — so growth percentage
> is calculated in one pass without joining the table to itself.
> **Result: 2010→2011: +6.1% | 2011→2012: -12.3%**

---

**Holiday Lift % using NULLIF**
```sql
SELECT ROUND(
    ((AVG(CASE WHEN Holiday_Flag = 1 THEN Weekly_Sales END) -
      AVG(CASE WHEN Holiday_Flag = 0 THEN Weekly_Sales END)) /
     NULLIF(AVG(CASE WHEN Holiday_Flag = 0 THEN Weekly_Sales END), 0)
    ) * 100, 2) AS holiday_lift_pct
FROM walmart_sales;
```
> `NULLIF(expression, 0)` returns NULL instead of 0 when the denominator is zero.
> This prevents a division-by-zero error that would crash the query
> if non-holiday data were ever missing from the table.
> **Result: +8% overall holiday lift**

---

**Holiday Lift by Month — Self Join on CTE**
```sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT Month, Holiday_Flag, AVG(Weekly_Sales) AS avg_sales
    FROM walmart_sales GROUP BY Month, Holiday_Flag
)
SELECT h.Month,
    ROUND(h.avg_sales, 0) AS holiday_avg,
    ROUND(r.avg_sales, 0) AS regular_avg,
    ROUND(((h.avg_sales - r.avg_sales) / r.avg_sales) * 100, 1) AS lift_pct
FROM monthly_sales h
JOIN monthly_sales r ON h.Month = r.Month
WHERE h.Holiday_Flag = 1 AND r.Holiday_Flag = 0
ORDER BY lift_pct DESC;
```
> The CTE contains both holiday rows and regular rows.
> Joining it to itself — alias `h` for holiday, alias `r` for regular —
> with `ON h.Month = r.Month` ensures November holidays are compared
> only against November regular weeks, not the overall average.
> **Result: November +42% | December -29%**

---

**Store Risk Scoring**
```sql
WITH store_metrics AS (
    SELECT Store,
        SUM(Weekly_Sales)    AS total_sales,
        AVG(Unemployment)    AS avg_unemployment,
        STDDEV(Weekly_Sales) AS volatility
    FROM walmart_sales GROUP BY Store
)
SELECT Store,
    ROUND(total_sales, 0)      AS total_sales,
    ROUND(avg_unemployment, 2) AS avg_unemployment,
    ROUND(volatility, 0)       AS volatility,
    CASE
        WHEN avg_unemployment >= 10 AND total_sales < 15000000 THEN 'Critical Risk'
        WHEN avg_unemployment >= 9  OR  total_sales < 10000000 THEN 'High Risk'
        WHEN avg_unemployment >= 7.5                           THEN 'Medium Risk'
        ELSE 'Low Risk'
    END AS risk_category
FROM store_metrics
ORDER BY
    CASE WHEN risk_category = 'Critical Risk' THEN 1
         WHEN risk_category = 'High Risk'     THEN 2
         ELSE 3 END, total_sales;
```
> `STDDEV` measures how much a store's sales swing week to week.
> High standard deviation means one week it sells a lot, the next very little —
> a sign of supply chain, staffing, or local economic instability.
> Combining volatility + unemployment + revenue threshold produces
> a single prioritized intervention list for management.

---

**Store-Wise Holiday Lift with HAVING**
```sql
SELECT Store,
    ROUND(((AVG(CASE WHEN Holiday_Flag = 1 THEN Weekly_Sales END) -
             AVG(CASE WHEN Holiday_Flag = 0 THEN Weekly_Sales END)) /
             AVG(CASE WHEN Holiday_Flag = 0 THEN Weekly_Sales END)) * 100, 2)
    AS holiday_lift_pct
FROM walmart_sales
GROUP BY Store
HAVING
    COUNT(CASE WHEN Holiday_Flag = 1 THEN 1 END) >= 2
AND COUNT(CASE WHEN Holiday_Flag = 0 THEN 1 END) >= 2
ORDER BY holiday_lift_pct DESC;
```
> `WHERE` filters rows before grouping.
> `HAVING` filters after grouping — allowing aggregate conditions.
> Without this guard, a store with only 1 holiday week would produce
> a misleading average based on a single data point.
> Requiring at least 2 holiday weeks and 2 regular weeks ensures reliable results.

---

**Seasonality Index using CROSS JOIN**
```sql
WITH monthly AS (
    SELECT Month, AVG(Weekly_Sales) AS avg_sales
    FROM walmart_sales GROUP BY Month
),
overall AS (SELECT AVG(Weekly_Sales) AS overall_avg FROM walmart_sales)
SELECT m.Month,
    ROUND(m.avg_sales, 0)                          AS month_avg,
    ROUND(o.overall_avg, 0)                        AS annual_avg,
    ROUND((m.avg_sales / o.overall_avg) * 100, 1) AS seasonality_index,
    CASE
        WHEN (m.avg_sales / o.overall_avg) * 100 >= 110 THEN 'Peak Season'
        WHEN (m.avg_sales / o.overall_avg) * 100 <= 90  THEN 'Slow Season'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END AS season_label
FROM monthly m CROSS JOIN overall o
ORDER BY m.Month;
```
> The `overall` CTE returns exactly one row — the grand average.
> `CROSS JOIN` multiplies every row in `monthly` (12 rows) with that single row,
> making the overall average available in every monthly row for division.
> Index > 100 → above average → increase inventory.
> Index < 100 → below average → reduce stock and plan clearance.

---

#### SQL Views for Power BI

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_yearly_sales AS
SELECT Year, SUM(Weekly_Sales) AS total_sales
FROM walmart_sales GROUP BY Year;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_monthly_seasonality AS
SELECT Month, Month_Name, AVG(Weekly_Sales) AS avg_weekly_sales
FROM walmart_sales GROUP BY Month, Month_Name ORDER BY Month;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_store_performance AS
SELECT Store, SUM(Weekly_Sales) AS total_sales,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(Weekly_Sales) DESC) AS store_rank
FROM walmart_sales GROUP BY Store;

CREATE VIEW vw_dim_date AS
SELECT DISTINCT Date, Year, Month, Month_Name, Week,
       QUARTER(Date) AS Quarter,
       CASE WHEN Holiday_Flag = 1 THEN 'Holiday' ELSE 'Regular' END AS Date_Type
FROM walmart_sales;
```

> **Why Views and not exported tables:**
> Views are virtual tables — they always reflect the current state of `walmart_sales`.
> When Power BI connects to a view, refreshing the dashboard pulls the latest data automatically.
> No manual re-exports needed.
> This is the standard production approach: one source of truth, no duplicated logic.

## 💡 Key Business Insights

```
🔴  CRITICAL  — November holiday lift = +42%
               Increase inventory 40% before October 15th every year

🔴  CRITICAL  — December = -29% lift vs November
               Do NOT replicate November stock levels for December
               Start clearance sales in the first week of December

🟡  WARNING   — Stores 12, 28, 38 in 13.12% unemployment zones
               High economic risk + low revenue = intervention needed now

🟡  WARNING   — 2012 showed -12.3% YoY decline
               Linked to rising unemployment — a leading indicator to monitor

🟢  STRENGTH  — Store 20 leads at $301M total revenue
               Document its practices and replicate to mid-tier stores

🟢  STRENGTH  — Sales are stable relative to CPI movement
               Walmart customers are largely inflation-resilient

🟢  STRENGTH  — July and April are strongest non-holiday months
               Good windows for mid-year promotional campaigns
